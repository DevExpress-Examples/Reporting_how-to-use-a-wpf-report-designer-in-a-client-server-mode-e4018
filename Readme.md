# How to use a WPF Report Designer in a client-server mode


<p>This example illustrates the legacy API that was used to run the older version of the Report Designer for WPF in a client-server mode.</p>
<p>This control was discontinued, and starting with version 15.2, we recommend you use the <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/CustomDocument114104">newer Report Designer version</a> instead.</p>
